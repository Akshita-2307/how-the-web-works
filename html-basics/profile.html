    <h1>Hii, I'm Akshita.</h1>
    <img src="myphoto.jpeg" height="230" width="220" alt="Akshita">
    <p>I am currently pursuing B.tech in computer science from Narula Institute of Technology.Tech world has always fascinated me,and opting for btech is my first step into this huge world.Currently I am learning Web Development along with C and Python.Below is my Github profile. Do visit to know more about me.Well this is a short description about who Akshita is and what she is doing.</p>

    <h4>Suggestions I'll give as I continue my webdev journey:-</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start from the basics:-</strong>
                Don't jump directly into html,css and js. These are very fancy names and sometimes feels scary also,but what's important is that you don't directly jump into this well.Start from the root level (Ps:-open my github repo[how web works]) and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

            </li>
            <li><strong>Consistency is the key:-</strong>
            You know when you'll first begin,you'll find everything very intriguing but that's a trap dear,save yourself.Don't try to eat everything in one go,trust me that's no fun. Eat then repeat then repeat.Don't bite more than you can chew.Never stop scratching that itch of curiosity.
            
            
            </li>
            <li><strong>Keep updating:-</strong>
            This world is full of competition,nobody will speak for you.Well people might speak against you, but never for you. So let your work speak for yourself. Keep posting even your smallest win because if you won't someone else definitely will. Keep your linkedIn and Github updated just as your instagram. Trust me you'll thank me later. </li>



        </ol>
    <strong>Learning Never Ends:-</strong>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>After 6 months approximately when I'll reach the peak of the mountain named Webdev,I am definitely not going to stop.

        </li>
        <li>I'll get my hands on cloud for sure.</li>
        <li>Secondly I'll be doing Cyber Security stuff.</li>
        <li>I'm also thinking of opting freelancing to gain some experience and to get some review on my skills.</li>


    </ul>
    <h4>Gyaan ki Baatein:-</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>Let's us understand html with an analogy. Everyone have seen a car,but inorder for a car to function properly there are several steps.Cars aren't made magically.The first thing you need to do is to design the basic layout of you car,like you want it big or small or sleek whatever. That outer structure of your car is HTML.HTML provides the basic layout of a webpage. It's doesn't give you fancy logos or colours.It just builds a structure.</dd>
        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>Now when our structure is ready, no one's going to buy it like that. You need to make it look eye pleasing and inorder to do that we need "colours". That's exactly what CSS does to our webpage,makes it standout.It designs our page and make it look every catchy and beautiful.All the different colours and designs you see on a webpage that comes from our beloved CSS,who fills colours into our black and white world.</dd>
        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>Now again,will anyone buy a car which doen't function but looks pleasing?? That's a rhetorical question by the way.In order to make it work we need components,like gears,handels,brakes and many more.This is where our saviour "javascript comes into the picture". It provides all the basic functioning unit of our webpage including clicking,scrolling,summiting forms,typing and the list goes on and on.</dd>
