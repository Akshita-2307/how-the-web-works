# How the web works
# What is the Internet?
The internet is a global network of computers that are connected to each other to share information. It allows devices to communicate using standard rules and protocols.

# Client and Server
A client is the user’s device or browser that requests information.  
A server is a powerful computer that stores websites and responds to client requests.

# Role of Browser
The browser acts as a bridge between the client and the server. It sends requests to the server and displays the response in a user-friendly way.

# What Happens When You Type a URL?
When a user types a URL in the browser, the browser sends a request to the server. The server processes this request and sends the required data back to the browser. The browser then displays the website to the user. This process follows the request–response model.
